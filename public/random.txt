ok, lets discuss a overall project structure.
also at the knowing stage what can be our questions to client.

1. Making an ai chat bot automations.
2. Client already has a n8n engine deployed (may be that can connect to the chat's like whatsapp, facebook, instagram)

3. Our task is to design the database and make an interface with next.js (both backend and frontend) and also going to deploy it to AWS.

4. The user(customer of this platform) can be a tenant, a tenant will have (admin, viewer, editor) 3 roles. and admin can add new members

5. users can do based on permission. (agentlist.create, agentlist.view) etc, all event need to have an unique token. that permission can be grant/revoke per user

So, There are 3 main modules. a.Agent Creation (Ai Chat bot). b.Data Source, c.Access Api/Secrets of whatsapp/messenger/instagram

a. Agent Creation
in the clients figma i can see 8 fields to create an agent.
1. agent description - text
2. agent model - select - `

3. agent memory - select - `None

Actions

4. Tools / Data Source [As there is another module 'Data Source' user can upload sheets/csv/API/Webhook]

5. Agent Icon - Given bunch of icons [matter of ui just]

6. Agent Instructions - text-area

7. Tools / Data Source instructions

8. Agent Response [here a placeholder was inserted "JSON object containing "next_agent_id" and "reason"."]

And there is a button 'Test Agent' to check the connection is working / credintials are correct.

before going to next module,
you saw mark-01 and mark-02
mark-01 has opened a modal (Model Credintial), and that has two form and both has 2 of fields
Google Gemini [Host, ApiKey]
OpenAi [Host, ApiKey]

mark-02: clicking mark 2 opens another modal has 2 form with each 1 field.
ProstgresSQL [Connection String]
MongoDb [Connection String]

mark-02 has a different view. every chat maybe save to users personal db
